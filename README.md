# 🛡️ Phishing URL Classifier

A machine learning-based project that detects phishing websites by classifying URLs as phishing or legitimate. The model is trained on various extracted URL-based features using traditional ML classifiers.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
📁 Phishing-URL-Classifier/
├── Phishing_URL_Classification.ipynb
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt (optional)
```

## 🚀 Features

- Extracts and analyzes URL-based features
- Applies machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and more
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🧪 Dataset

The notebook assumes the dataset is preloaded or fetched directly. Make sure the dataset is accessible in the code if run from scratch.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

> For full details, see the notebook: **Phishing_URL_Classification.ipynb**

## 📊 Model Performance

Various classifiers were evaluated, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to compare results.

## 🧰 How to Run
